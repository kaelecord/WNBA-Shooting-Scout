# WNBA Shooting Scout
The goal of this web app is to provide access to WNBA shooting charts that can be hard to find at times. Similar plots can be found on [WNBA.com](https://stats.wnba.com/), however I find it hard to navigate to get the exact shot chart you are looking for. Inside this web app you'll be able to get a player or team's shot chart, shot zone chart, heat map, and stream plot for a wide range of specific scenarios. Do you want to see how your favorite team shot against their bitter rival? Simply select your team, find their rival in the opponent filter, and have fun exploring. Maybe you want to see how Caitlin Clark performed after the Olympic break. Well then you're in the right spot! Select the Fever, Caitlin Clark, and filter her shot chart by the date range you are looking for and you're off to the races. Now, hand up,üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, I'm very aware this is not the most visually appealing web app you have come across. Getting the formatting as it sits right now was already more than enough CSS than I bargained for, however in the future I hope to update this as I learn more. Along those same lines, another flaw that became very apparent was how well (or the lack thereof) the current design transfers to mobile. Once again, not in my CSS bag right now.
